# LesoNotes
My first React Application made from scratch.


## What is this?
This App allows you to create notes and save them locally in your browsers storage. This is handy since you can go back and check on your notes even if you have closed the browser.

You can also paste formatted content inside the area where you write. Copy things from web pages and paste them and they will look the same.
